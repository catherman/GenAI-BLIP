# GenAI BLIP

Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining (BLIP):  Leverages both text and image data to enhance AI models' understanding and generation of image descriptions.  It bridges the gap between natural language and visual content, or NLP & Computer Vision.

For this, we used "Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base" from Huggings Face.

The code was run in colab.
